# AGENTS

Cross-agent rulebook. Read at task start (always in context for OpenCode, Claude Code, etc.).

## Stack

SvelteKit · Cloudflare Pages + Workers · D1 + Drizzle · Vitest + Playwright · pnpm · stylebase + Bits UI · Storybook.

## Git workflow

- Always branch from `main`. Pull latest `main` before creating the new branch.
- All tasks are reviewed in a pull request.
- The agent never pushes directly to `main` and never merges to `main`. The human reviews the PR and merges.
- The human is the commit author for all commits. Agent-made commits add a `Co-authored-by: opencode <noreply@opencode.ai>` trailer to credit assistance.

## Layout

- `AGENTS.md` — this file
- `agent-notes/` — chronological task notes (one per task, written at end)
- `agent-notes/plans/` — plan artifacts (write-only at task end, not auto-loaded)
- `.opencode/skills/` — in-repo skills (cross-cutting process skills live in your global plugin, not here)

## Authoring boundaries

Humans own:
- Svelte component markup
- Svelte `<style>` blocks
- CSS files in `src/lib/styles/`
- Layout, spacing, typography, design tokens

Agents own (TypeScript only):
- `<script lang="ts">` blocks within `.svelte` files
- `*.ts` files in `src/lib/`, `src/routes/`
- Drizzle schemas and queries
- Server routes, API integrations, Workers

## Working style

Process skills live in `~/.agents/skills/`. Load the relevant one when it
clearly applies (don't load for the sake of loading):

- `tdd` — test-first (vertical slices, user-confirmed priorities)
- `diagnose` — hard bugs (build a feedback loop first)
- `prototype` — throwaway code that answers a question
- `review` — two-axis PR review (Standards + Spec)
- `qa` — conversational bug reports → durable GitHub issues
- `handoff` — compact the session for the next agent
- `caveman` — terse mode, ~75% token drop
- `write-a-skill` — authoring a new skill

Zed's plan/build mode toggle is the human's lever — follow the active mode
without prompting. See **Verification before completion** for done criteria.

## Task lifecycle

End-of-task skill: `.opencode/skills/task-lifecycle/SKILL.md`. The agent owns the task note — create it at task end without being asked, regardless of task size. Size of note scales with task.

## Releases

Suede uses [chronver](https://chronver.org). Version lives in `package.json#version` (chronver format `YYYY.M.D[.N][-feature|-break]`; `pnpm version` normalizes leading zeros, so e.g. `2026.6.4`, not `2026.06.04`).

**Every release branch — a branch ready to be reviewed and merged to `main` — ships as its own chronver version.** The bump is the final commit on the release branch, before merge. No versionless merges.

### Cutting a release

1. Final commit on the release branch, before merge, is `chore(release): cut <version>`. Bump with `pnpm version <version> --no-git-tag-version` (or hand-edit), commit only the `version` field.
2. Tag the merge commit on `main` with the bare chronver string, annotated. Push with `git push origin main --follow-tags`.
3. `git log <prev>..<new>` is the changelog. No `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Downstream lineage

When a project duplicates suede, it adds `"suede": { "from": "<tag>" }` to its own `package.json` with the chronver tag of the suede commit it branched from. Suede's own `package.json` carries no such field.

### Version policy

chronver for apps and templates (temporal releases, no API contract to break); semver for packages consumed by dependents (persistent breaking-change signals).

## Decision Graph Workflow

Suede tracks project decisions through the `deciduous` decision-graph tool. This section is the cross-agent view: it describes the `deciduous` CLI and the graph model, which are tool-agnostic. Tool-specific commands and skills live in `.opencode/commands/` and `.opencode/skills/` (OpenCode) and are loaded by OpenCode at runtime; they are not duplicated here.

**THIS IS MANDATORY. Log decisions IN REAL-TIME, not retroactively.**

### The Node Flow Rule - CRITICAL

The canonical flow through the decision graph is:

```
goal -> options -> decision -> actions -> outcomes
```

- **Goals** lead to **options** (possible approaches to explore)
- **Options** lead to a **decision** (choosing which option to pursue)
- **Decisions** lead to **actions** (implementing the chosen approach)
- **Actions** lead to **outcomes** (results of the implementation)
- **Observations** attach anywhere relevant
- Goals do NOT lead directly to decisions -- there must be options first
- Options do NOT come after decisions -- options come BEFORE decisions
- Decision nodes should only be created when an option is actually chosen, not prematurely

### The Core Rule

```
BEFORE you do something -> Log what you're ABOUT to do
AFTER it succeeds/fails -> Log the outcome
CONNECT immediately -> Link every node to its parent
AUDIT regularly -> Check for missing connections
```

### Behavioral Triggers - MUST LOG WHEN:

| Trigger | Log Type | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| User asks for a new feature | `goal` **with -p** | "Add dark mode" |
| Exploring possible approaches | `option` | "Use Redux for state" |
| Choosing between approaches | `decision` | "Choose state management" |
| About to write/edit code | `action` | "Implementing Redux store" |
| Something worked or failed | `outcome` | "Redux integration successful" |
| Notice something interesting | `observation` | "Existing code uses hooks" |

### What NOT to Log - CRITICAL

**The decision graph records the USER'S project decisions, not your internal process.**

Nodes should capture what the user is building, choosing, and accomplishing. Do NOT create nodes for your own thinking, planning, or tooling steps.

**DO NOT create nodes for:**
- Reading/exploring the codebase ("Analyzing project structure", "Reading config files")
- Your planning process ("Planning implementation approach", "Evaluating options internally")
- Tool usage ("Running tests to check status", "Checking git log")
- Context gathering ("Understanding existing auth code", "Reviewing PR comments")
- Meta-commentary ("Starting work on this task", "Preparing to implement")

**DO create nodes for:**
- What the user asked for (goals)
- Concrete approaches being considered (options)
- Choices made between approaches (decisions)
- Code being written or changed (actions)
- Results of implementation (outcomes)
- Technical findings that affect decisions (observations)

**Rule of thumb:** If a node describes something the user would put on a project timeline or in a PR description, log it. If it describes your internal process of reading and thinking, don't.

### Document Attachments

Attach files (images, PDFs, diagrams, specs, screenshots) to decision graph nodes for rich context.

```bash
# Attach a file to a node
deciduous doc attach <node_id> <file_path>
deciduous doc attach <node_id> <file_path> -d "Architecture diagram"

# List documents
deciduous doc list              # All documents
deciduous doc list <node_id>    # Documents for a specific node

# Manage documents
deciduous doc show <doc_id>     # Show document details
deciduous doc describe <doc_id> "Updated description"
deciduous doc open <doc_id>     # Open in default application
deciduous doc detach <doc_id>   # Soft-delete (recoverable)
deciduous doc gc                # Remove orphaned files from disk
```

**When to suggest document attachment:**

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| User shares an image or screenshot | Ask: "Want me to attach this to the current goal/action node?" |
| User references an external document | Ask: "Should I attach a copy to the decision graph?" |
| Architecture diagram is discussed | Suggest attaching it to the relevant goal node |
| Files not in the project are dropped in | Attach to the most relevant active node |

**Do NOT aggressively prompt for documents.** Only suggest when files are directly relevant to a decision node. Files are stored in `.deciduous/documents/` with content-hash naming for deduplication.

### CRITICAL: Capture VERBATIM User Prompts

**Prompts must be the EXACT user message, not a summary.** When a user request triggers new work, capture their full message word-for-word.

**BAD - summaries are useless for context recovery:**
```bash
# DON'T DO THIS - this is a summary, not a prompt
deciduous add goal "Add auth" -p "User asked: add login to the app"
```

**GOOD - verbatim prompts enable full context recovery:**
```bash
# Use --prompt-stdin for multi-line prompts
deciduous add goal "Add auth" -c 90 --prompt-stdin << 'EOF'
I need to add user authentication to the app. Users should be able to sign up
with email/password, and we need OAuth support for Google and GitHub. The auth
should use JWT tokens with refresh token rotation.
EOF

# Or use the prompt command to update existing nodes
deciduous prompt 42 << 'EOF'
The full verbatim user message goes here...
EOF
```

**When to capture prompts:**
- Root `goal` nodes: YES - the FULL original request
- Major direction changes: YES - when user redirects the work
- Routine downstream nodes: NO - they inherit context via edges

**Updating prompts on existing nodes:**
```bash
deciduous prompt <node_id> "full verbatim prompt here"
cat prompt.txt | deciduous prompt <node_id>  # Multi-line from stdin
```

Prompts are viewable in the web viewer.

### CRITICAL: Maintain Connections

**The graph's value is in its CONNECTIONS, not just nodes.**

| When you create... | IMMEDIATELY link to... |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| `outcome` | The action that produced it |
| `action` | The decision that spawned it |
| `decision` | The option(s) it chose between |
| `option` | Its parent goal |
| `observation` | Related goal/action |
| `revisit` | The decision/outcome being reconsidered |

**Root `goal` nodes are the ONLY valid orphans.**

### Quick Commands

```bash
deciduous add goal "Title" -c 90 -p "User's original request"
deciduous add action "Title" -c 85
deciduous link FROM TO -r "reason"  # DO THIS IMMEDIATELY!
deciduous serve   # View live (auto-refreshes every 30s)
deciduous sync    # Export for static hosting

# Metadata flags
# -c, --confidence 0-100   Confidence level
# -p, --prompt "..."       Store the user prompt (use when semantically meaningful)
# -f, --files "a.rs,b.rs"  Associate files
# -b, --branch <name>      Git branch (auto-detected)
# --commit <hash|HEAD>     Link to git commit (use HEAD for current commit)
# --date "YYYY-MM-DD"      Backdate node (for archaeology)

# Branch filtering
deciduous nodes --branch main
deciduous nodes -b feature-auth
```

### CRITICAL: Link Commits to Actions/Outcomes

**After every git commit, link it to the decision graph!**

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add auth"
deciduous add action "Implemented auth" -c 90 --commit HEAD
deciduous link <goal_id> <action_id> -r "Implementation"
```

The `--commit HEAD` flag captures the commit hash and links it to the node. The web viewer will show commit messages, authors, and dates.

### Git History & Deployment

```bash
# Export graph AND git history for web viewer
deciduous sync

# This creates:
# - docs/graph-data.json (decision graph)
# - docs/git-history.json (commit info for linked nodes)
```

The exported `docs/` directory is gitignored (regenerated per machine via `deciduous sync`). The web viewer is browsable locally with `deciduous serve`; for a hosted view, deploy `docs/` to a static host.

### Branch-Based Grouping

Nodes are auto-tagged with the current git branch. Configure in `.deciduous/config.toml`:
```toml
[branch]
main_branches = ["main", "master"]
auto_detect = true
```

### Audit Checklist (Before Every Sync)

1. Does every **outcome** link back to what caused it?
2. Does every **action** link to why you did it?
3. Any **dangling outcomes** without parents?

### Git Staging Rules - CRITICAL

**NEVER use broad git add commands that stage everything:**
- ❌ `git add -A` - stages ALL changes including untracked files
- ❌ `git add .` - stages everything in current directory
- ❌ `git add -a` or `git commit -am` - auto-stages all tracked changes
- ❌ `git add *` - glob patterns can catch unintended files

**ALWAYS stage files explicitly by name:**
- ✅ `git add src/lib/components/ui/Button.svelte`
- ✅ `git add package.json pnpm-lock.yaml`
- ✅ `git add .opencode/commands/work.md`

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents accidentally committing sensitive files (.env, credentials)
- Prevents committing large binaries or build artifacts
- Forces you to review exactly what you're committing
- Catches unintended changes before they enter git history

### Session Start Checklist

```bash
deciduous check-update    # Update needed? Run 'deciduous update' if yes
                          # (auto-checked every 24h if auto-update is on)
deciduous nodes           # What decisions exist?
deciduous edges           # What connections? Any gaps?
deciduous doc list        # Any attached documents to review?
git status                # Current state
```

### Multi-User Sync

Sync decisions with teammates via event logs:

```bash
# Check sync status
deciduous events status

# Apply teammate events (after git pull)
deciduous events rebuild

# Compact old events periodically
deciduous events checkpoint --clear-events
```

Events auto-emit on add/link/status commands. Git merges event files automatically.

## Guardrails

Always:
- Create an `agent-notes/` entry at task end.
- Run verification before claiming done.
- Preserve `agent-notes/` history (append, never delete).

Never:
- Modify the presentation layer (Svelte markup, scoped CSS, `src/lib/styles/`).
- Skip the task note.
- Commit secrets.

## Verification before completion

- `pnpm lint` — pass
- `pnpm check` — pass
- `pnpm test` — run if tests changed

Claim done with evidence: command + result.
